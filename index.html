    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Serenity -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is designed as an interactive "digital letter" to transform a beautiful, personal message into an engaging experience. The structure is a single, vertically scrolling page that guides the reader (Adhil) through the content in a narrative flow. It begins with a heartfelt title, moves to an interactive grid for the "40 Reasons" to encourage exploration and focus on each point, and then presents the prose in beautifully styled, thematic sections ("Our Journey," "A Promise," "Our Future"). This structure was chosen over a static text page to make the act of reading the letter feel more special and to honor the depth of the content by giving each part its own space and focus, enhancing the emotional impact. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: The source material is purely qualitative and emotional. Therefore, traditional data charts are inappropriate. Instead, the "visualizations" are focused on presentation and interaction. Report Info: The 40 reasons to love Adhil. -> Goal: Engage & Emphasize -> Viz/Presentation Method: An interactive grid of cards built with HTML/Tailwind and JS. -> Interaction: Each card starts by showing only its number. On click, it flips or fades to reveal the reason. -> Justification: This slows down the reading process, making each reason a small discovery and preventing the list from feeling like a long wall of text. It encourages the user to actively engage with the content. Report Info: The heartfelt paragraphs. -> Goal: Convey deep emotion and sincerity. -> Viz/Presentation Method: Thematic text blocks with elegant typography. -> Interaction: Minimal, primarily scrolling, with gentle fade-in animations. -> Justification: For prose of this nature, readability and a serene presentation are paramount. Complex interactions would distract from the power of the words. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

                    I’m sure whatever I write, it won't end. We went through a lot together, we cried, laughed, and gave up together. We had a million fights but whenever we leave, we always come back, and every time we come back because of you. There are a lot of reasons I’m sure I forgot, but it doesn’t mean I don’t know them. I hope whenever you feel, or I make you feel, that I don't see how much you love me, you come read this to believe how I see you and how much you’re amazing in my eyes, even if my actions or words in our bad time will show the opposite.
